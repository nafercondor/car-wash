This module provide and usefull helper to use mongoose library.

See official documentation [here](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose).

## Compatibility

The minimum supported version of Node.js is v8.

## How to use it

To use the library you just need to follow the following steps

Install the library with npm

```js
npm  install @condor-labs/mongodb
```

Import the library:

```js
const mongodb = require("@condor-labs/mongodb")(settings);
```

### `settings` array of object properties

those are the properties for each connection object

### In case you want to connect to mongo Atlas via cluster,

1. You should check the connection metrics of your cluster.You must verify that this is your ip 
<img width="1664" alt="Captura de Pantalla 2021-09-29 a la(s) 9 58 37 p  m" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78800255/135379384-d314cf97-3161-4b03-b3b9-7a7f592eb7c9.png">


2. Copy the hosts of your metrics and concatenate them in the host property of your connection configuration to mongo example: in its connection parameters.
Only the url of this section should be included, separated by commas.

**host:** 'cluster0-shard-00-00.ksccs.mongodb.net,cluster0-shard-00-01.ksccs.mongodb.net,cluster0-shard-00-02.ksccs.mongodb.net'

3. You may have an authentication error, you must verify that your user has read and write permissions.

this error may also be due to not adding the **authSource** attribute in the configuration json. 


## Example Code

this is an example for multiple connections:

First we are going to create an array of connections

```js
const mongoDbSettings = [
  {
    connectionName: "connection_mongo_1",
    host: "localhost",
    port: 27017,
    database: "development",
    user: "local-user",
    password: "superSecretPass",
    ssl: false,
  },
  {
    connectionName: "connection_mongo_2",
    host: "exapmle-shard-00-00-8burs.mongodb.net,exapmle-shard-00-01-8burs.mongodb.net,exapmle-shard-00-02-8burs.mongodb.net",
    port: 27017,
    database: "dev",
    user: "my-user-2",
    password: "superSecretPass",
    replicaSet: "compliance-support-shard-0",
    ssl: true,
    authSource: "admin",
  },
];
```

We are going to create a helper (mongoHelper.js) that will included the following logic

```js
"use strict";

const mongo = require("@condor-labs/mongodb")(mongoDbSettings);

const helper = {
  clients: {}, // In clients we will save our connections that the library send us
  isConnected: (connectionName) => {
    return mongo._isConnected(connectionName);
  },
  connect: async () => {
    // It will connect every connection on the array "mongoDbSettings"
    for (const item of mongoDbSettings) {
      let client = await mongo.getClient(item.connectionName);
      helper.clients[item.connectionName] = client;
    }
  },
};

module.exports = helper;
```

now we are going to create our models

model1.js

```js
const mongodb = require("@condor-labs/mongodb")();
const helperMongo = require("./mongoHelper");

let userSchema = new mongodb.mongoose.Schema({
  user: String,
  token: String,
  password: String,
});

const dbConnection = helperMongo.clients["connection_mongo_1"]; // I got the name of the connection from mongoDbSettings
let userModel = dbConnection.model("User", userSchema); // then I am able to create a my model based on the connection object that I got using my helper

module.exports = userModel;
```

my sencond model will be similar to the previeus one but instead of using connection_mongo_1 connection I will use connection_mongo_2

model2.js

```js
const mongodb = require("@condor-labs/mongodb")();
const helperMongo = require("./mongoHelper");

let userSchema = new mongodb.mongoose.Schema({
  user: String,
  token: String,
  password: String,
});

const dbConnection = helperMongo.clients["connection_mongo_2"]; // I got the name of the connection from mongoDbSettings
let userModel = dbConnection.model("User", userSchema); // then I am able to create a my model based on the connection object that I got using my helper

module.exports = userModel;
```

Finallly, after all those configuration we are going to test our connection on our server.js file that includes the following code.

server.js

```js

mongoDbHelper.connect().then(async () => {
  // Load helpers
  const userModelDB1 = require("./model1");
